    <h3>A Wake-Up Call for Investors</h3>
    <p>
        In November 2024, India’s competition regulator imposed a monetary penalty on a major technology company in connection with a privacy policy update implemented by one of its popular messaging applications. The core issue was that the updated policy required users to compulsorily consent to the sharing of their personal data with affiliated group entities, without offering users the ability to opt out. The regulator found this practice to be anti-competitive, sending a strong signal about the increasing regulatory scrutiny over data privacy in India. In India’s increasingly digital economy, for private equity investors, particularly those backing consumer-focused or digital-first businesses, this is a wake-up call. Data privacy compliance is no longer a backend checklist or a theoretical risk. It is core to transaction value, risk allocation and to sustained performance post-investment.
    </p>

    <h3>The New Reality: From Patchwork to Priority</h3>
    <p>
        Until recently, India’s data privacy landscape was fragmented. Previously, data privacy obligations were sector-specific, with stronger oversight in areas like financial services and telecommunications, but minimal guidance elsewhere. Many startups and mid-sized businesses operated with vague privacy commitments and limited accountability.
    </p>
    <p>
        With the introduction of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (“DPDPA”), India has taken a significant step towards establishing a national privacy law that would apply on a sector agnostic basis. The DPDPA places legal obligations on companies handling personal data, including requirements to obtain clear consent, implement purpose limitation while processing personal data, allow individuals to access and erase their data, and notify the Data Protection Board of India and affected individuals of any breaches. It also introduces penalties that can reach up to INR 250 crores (~USD 30 million) for certain offences, underscoring the seriousness with which the law is expected to approach the violations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data is now seen not just as an operational asset, but a liability if mishandled. Companies collecting personal data, whether from customers, employees, or vendors, are expected to do so transparently, responsibly, and securely. What has shifted is not just regulation, but societal expectation. Consumers are more aware of their rights and more likely to question how their data is being used. Investors are more concerned about data-related exposure and are beginning to expect demonstrable accountability.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Legal and Technical Diligence Must Go Hand in Hand</h3>
    <p>
        The traditional approach to diligence, reviewing policies, contracts, and compliance certificates may not reveal how personal data is actually managed on the ground. A company may appear compliant on paper while being highly exposed in practice. It might have a privacy policy on its website but lack the systems or staff to enforce it. It may claim to follow ‘best practices’ while lacking a functioning grievance redressal process. A company may not have any mechanism to track or log user consents. It may list data protection as a risk factor but use third-party vendors without appropriate data processing agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the DPDPA sharpens regulatory teeth, investors must assess not just legal posture, but operational maturity. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Reviewing how personal data is mapped, where it resides, who has access, and for how long.</li>
        <li>Verifying whether consent mechanisms are aligned with the DPDPA’s requirements.</li>
        <li>Confirming that data-sharing arrangements with vendors are documented and compliant.</li>
        <li>Assessing whether the company can support user rights and grievance redressal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Shift from Reactive to Preventive Thinking</h3>
    <p>
        Many businesses still approach data privacy compliance as a reactive discipline. Fixes come only after prolonged non-compliance, but that mindset is no longer tenable, and increasingly, it is proving costly. The fallout from a data privacy non-compliance now extends far beyond technical disruptions. It can involve the loss of data, regulatory investigation, reputational harm, customer attrition, and potential legal claims. For private equity investors, the ripple effects can include delayed integrations, derailed value creation plans, and reduced exit valuations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Achieving meaningful compliance also requires a cultural shift across the organisation. Responsibility for privacy and data protection compliance rest with IT / legal teams alone, every function must understand its role in handling personal data responsibly. Human resources must manage employee information with care and confidentiality, while sales and marketing teams should be trained to use personal data in a manner that is lawful, transparent, and aligned with consent. Embedding this awareness across functions is essential to building a privacy conscious organisation.
    </p>

    <h3>When Diligence Findings Reshape Deal Dynamics</h3>
    <p>
        What happens when diligence uncovers serious issues? The answer depends on how early they are identified, and how material they are. In many cases, buyers respond by reshaping the deal. This could mean revising the purchase price, building in escrow protections, delaying signing until fixes are completed, or adjusting earn-outs to be conditional on successful remediation.
    </p>
    <p>
        In others, it may lead to rethinking the transaction altogether, particularly if the exposure is systemic, or the brand damage is irreversible. Even with contractual protections in place, investors should remain vigilant. No warranty or indemnity clause can fully protect against the long-term consequences of a data failure. Regulatory fines, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust often extend well beyond what escrow arrangements or price adjustments can reasonably address.
    </p>

    <h3>Remediation Roadmaps: Closing the Gap Before Closing the Deal</h3>
    <p>
        Experienced investors do not wait for things to go wrong. Increasingly, they insist on a tailored remediation plan as a precondition to closing. This plan may be broken down into near-term, mid-term, and long-term actions. In the near term, companies are expected to take immediate corrective steps, such as updating privacy notices and consent mechanisms, patching data storage and access vulnerabilities, and instituting basic controls over who can handle sensitive data.
    </p>
    <p>
        Over the medium term, businesses are expected to embed privacy more deeply into internal operations. This includes appointing dedicated data protection leads, formalising breach response protocols, revising customer and employee data privacy policies, and conducting regular third-party risk assessments. In the longer run, scalable governance infrastructure becomes critical, and this includes automating consent and data rights management, conducting regular risk assessments, and implementing internal systems to monitor and audit ongoing compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Private equity firms can help accelerate this maturity curve by connecting remediation to commercial levers. Linking escrow releases, earn-out conditions, or milestone payments to the successful execution of key privacy and security initiatives ensures accountability and aligns incentives between parties.
    </p>

    <h3>Post-Close Integration: Turning Diligence into Discipline</h3>
    <p>
        The most successful firms adopt a centralised approach post-acquisition. They develop common privacy frameworks and security playbooks, share vetted tools and vendors across companies, and run joint training programmes. By doing this, they reduce costs, accelerate implementation, and ensure that smaller or younger portfolio companies do not fall behind.
    </p>

    <h3>Regulatory Outlook: Expect the Bar to Rise</h3>
    <p>
        India’s regulatory environment around data is still maturing and private equity firms should expect the bar to rise. What is considered best practice today may become a baseline requirement tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
        Future rule-making and enforcement trends are likely to demand clearer data handling practices, faster breach reporting timelines, and more accountability from business leaders. Cross-border data transfer restrictions may tighten. Third-party vendor oversight may be scrutinised more heavily. The cumulative effect: more pressure on companies to demonstrate real, ongoing compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
        In parallel, global developments will continue to shape expectations. India’s digital businesses, especially those seeking global customers or partners, will increasingly be judged against global benchmarks. Investors must stay alert to these shifts, both in India and internationally.
    </p>
    <p>
        Smart private equity firms are already building agility into their governance models by updating diligence checklists, redrafting template warranties, and refining board reporting frameworks to reflect these evolving norms.
    </p>

    <h3>A Strategic Imperative</h3>
    <p>
        For private equity firms investing in India’s digital-first economy, the implications are clear:
    </p>
    <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>Diligence must evolve.</li>
        <li>Prevention must become the norm and rectifying non-compliances and avoiding personal data breaches are far more valuable than reacting to them.</li>
        <li>Deal structures must adapt, and contractual protections, escrows, and earn-outs should reflect real risks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Firms that underestimate these risks may face operational disruption, regulatory exposure, and reputational harm that undermines deal value. But those who see data privacy compliance as a pillar of value creation can turn compliance into a competitive advantage. In an era where trust drives business, protecting personal data is not just good hygiene, it is good investing.
