                  It's not about how many GCCs are coming. It's about the kind
                  of companies now building their core in India. This isn't
                  noise. It's a controlled recalibration of the global operating
                  system and India is where the software is being rewritten.{" "}

                A European e-commerce firm, not quite a unicorn, quietly leased
                two floors in Pune. A climate-tech startup from the US shifted
                its entire analytics backend to Hyderabad. A B2B logistics
                company from Singapore began building a legal ops and FP&A team
                in Bengaluru, not to outsource work, but to embed India into its

                looking for thousands of engineers or sprawling campuses. What
                they wanted was agility, clarity, and control. What they built

              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>The Mid-Market GCC: Not a Satellite, But a Second Core</h3>
              <p>
                A mid-market Global Capability Centre (GCC) is not defined by
                headcount or hype. It’s defined by intent. Built by firms with
                revenues typically ranging from $100 million to $1 billion,
                these centers operate as cross-functional global extensions,
                lean, embedded, and operationally mature.
              </p>
              <p>
                They’re not built to experiment. They’re built to execute. And
                they’re often the company’s first full-stack global footprint.
              </p>
              <p>
                While earlier waves of GCCs focused on IT, these are
                multi-domain by default. A typical mid-market GCC may launch
                with just 200–300 people but span functions such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Legal operations</li>
                <li>Commercial finance and FP&A</li>
                <li>HR analytics and talent operations</li>
                <li>Data science and automation</li>
                <li>Customer success enablement</li>
                <li>Procurement and vendor strategy</li>
              </ul>
              <br />
              <p>
                The roles are layered. The teams are accountable. The systems
                are global from Day 1.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>
                What Changed: Why Mid-Market Firms Are Globalising Differently
              </h3>
              <p>
                These firms aren't new to growth. But they're new to
                globalisation.
              </p>
              <p>
                What they needed and finally got was a frictionless first step
                into global operations. India delivered that not through scale,
                but fit.
              </p>
              <p>Here's what quietly enabled this shift:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Hybrid-first infra:</strong> With a rise in managed
                  workspaces and plug-and-play campuses, companies no longer
                  need to commit to long leases or build physical HQs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Mature mid-career talent:</strong> India’s 5–15 year
                  professional cohort is experienced, tool-savvy, and already
                  trained on global workflows.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Digital policy maturity:</strong> The average Indian
                  professional understands GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001, and
                  increasingly, DPDPA without additional layers of translation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>State-level agility:</strong> Governments like Uttar
                  Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu are actively designing
                  policies and incentive models to attract these new entrants.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>India didn't just become viable. It became default.</p>
              <br />
              <h3>Inside the Architecture: A Mid-Market GCC Up Close</h3>
              <p>
                Step into a typical mid-market GCC in Pune’s Baner district or
                Bengaluru’s ORR.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's likely spread across two floors in a managed flex campus.
                The teams are tight-knit, interdisciplinary. Each vertical is
                led by a function owner who reports directly to global heads,
                not a local intermediary.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>A product pod is testing new UX designs.</li>
                <li>
                  The legal ops team is managing global NDAs and vendor reviews
                  on Ironclad.
                </li>
                <li>
                  FP&A analysts are syncing into the CEO’s Monday metrics call
                  with a dashboard that runs off Snowflake + Power BI.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A two-person people analytics cell is visualising retention
                  risks across global offices.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These teams aren't waiting for direction. They're delivering
                direction.
              </p>
              <p>
                In fact, in several companies, India-based professionals are
                defining workflows that the rest of the company later adopts.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>The Talent Migration No One Is Tracking</h3>
              <p>
                Perhaps the most under-reported signal in this story is what’s
                happening to India’s talent flows.
              </p>
              <p>Over the last 18 months, there’s been a steady exodus from:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Burned-out startup roles</li>
                <li>Overspecialised BPO jobs</li>
                <li>Consulting roles without clear progression</li>
                <li>Vendor environments with no product visibility</li>
              </ul>
              <p>And where are they going?</p>
              <p>Into GCCs that offer:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Clarity of function:</strong> Legal ops is legal ops,
                  not legal + admin + finance + fire-fighting.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Faster acceleration:</strong> In a 300-person GCC,
                  your next role is one desk away.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Global visibility:</strong> Reporting lines are flat,
                  often direct to US/UK/SG leads.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Culture sanity:</strong> The startup chaos and
                  consulting grind are replaced with scaled discipline.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These GCCs are becoming the preferred path for mid-career
                growth, offering international exposure without the personal
                cost of relocation. And this migration is only going to
                accelerate as more GCCs move into Tier 2 cities, where the
                hunger for such roles is even stronger.
              </p>
              <br />
              <h3>
                The Governance Blind Spots: Compliance as the Achilles Heel
              </h3>
              <p>
                For all their strategic maturity, most mid-market GCCs walk into
                India with one significant blind spot: governance
                under-readiness.
              </p>
              <p>What this typically looks like:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>No local DPO</strong> or privacy function, despite
                  handling cross-border personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>US or EU contracts reused</strong> without Indian law
                  localisation, especially in vendor agreements, NDAs, and
                  employment clauses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Improper contractor arrangements</strong>, freelancers
                  or consultants operating without valid documentation or
                  misclassified under Indian employment law.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Transfer pricing structures</strong> set up
                  reactively, creating long-term audit risk under India’s tax
                  code and FEMA regulations.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>Why does this happen?</p>
              <p>Because these firms scale fast but localise late.</p>
              <p>
                They rely on external advisors, but too often engage them at the
                point of enforcement risk, not during onboarding. With DPDPA
                enforcement expected to pick up by FY26, many of these GCCs are
                sitting on regulatory debt they haven't budgeted for.
              </p>
              <br />

              <p>
                The growth of mid-market GCCs isn’t just creating jobs. It’s

                <li>
                  Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are expected to follow with micro-SEZ
                  models for mid-sized GCCs under 1,000 seats.

                  Policy competition is moving from IT parks to function-ready
                  campuses.

              <h3>What’s Next: The Strategic Horizon to 2027</h3>
              <p>The signals suggest this is just the start.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  150+ more GCCs are projected to be added by FY27, mostly by
                  North American and EU-based mid-sized firms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Expect a functional deepening, centres that began with finance
                  and HR will move into product development, GTM support, and AI
                  operations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Several GCCs will begin owning P&L responsibility for entire
                  global units.
                </li>
                <li>
                  India’s model will get replicated in Vietnam, Poland, and
                  LATAM, but India will retain leadership due to its infra,
                  talent, and legal depth.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                By 2028, the idea that “GCCs are only for big firms” will look
                archaic. Mid-market GCCs will be the default globalisation model
                for modern enterprises.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Create India-specific onboarding kits for contracts, privacy,
                  vendor terms, and arbitration norms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Offer “red flag scans” for new GCCs to identify risk zones in
                  documentation and compliance.
                </li>
              </ul>

                <li>
                  Help GCCs map cost centers and entity structures to avoid
                  double exposure.
                </li>

                  and ESG-linked subsidies.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Offer GCC onboarding windows through Invest India or
                  state-level one-stop clearance teams.

              <h3>
                The Closing Signal: This Isn’t Just Growth. This Is Global
                Architecture Redrawn
              </h3>
              <p>
                This isn’t about how many GCCs were added. Or how many jobs were
                created. This is about who chose India and for what. These are
                companies that, until recently, never imagined building anything
                outside their home country. Today, they’re using India to run
                legal, finance, analytics, and product, often with more speed
                and confidence than their home office.
              </p>
              <p>
                This isn’t about offshore support. It’s about a second
                headquarters, silent, lean, and increasingly essential. And in
                that silence lies the real signal: India is no longer where the
                world comes to outsource. It’s where the world comes to build
                its operating core.
