                  In the last few weeks, a new supply chain alarm has quietly
                  started flashing across India's EV and electronics ecosystem.

                <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                  A growing number of Indian importers reportedly over 30
                  companies have been unable to move forward with their
                  shipments of critical rare-earth magnets from China. Not
                  because of logistics failure. Not due to payment defaults. But
                  due to a policy freeze.

                <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                  For importers bound by strict OEM supply timelines, this has

                  When external events - natural, political, or regulatory make
                  it impossible to fulfill a contract, most businesses turn to a
                  familiar legal clause: Force Majeure.
                </li>
                <li classname="text-sm">
                  Rooted in the idea of a "superior force," this clause allows
                  parties to pause obligations or delay performance when
                  something beyond their control disrupts delivery without
                  triggering penalties or legal breach.
                </li>
                <li classname="text-sm">
                  It doesn't cancel contracts. It doesn't cover every crisis.
                  But it creates legal breathing room, when used correctly, and
                  when backed by contract language that fits the disruption.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                In the past five years, force majeure has become central to
                global commerce:

              <ul className="mb-4 space-y-2 list-disc ml-6">
                <li classname="text-sm">
                  <strong>2020–21 (COVID-19):</strong> Lockdowns, labour

                  claims.

                  <strong>2022 (Russia–Ukraine War):</strong> Cross-border
                  contracts collapsed due to sanctions and logistical
                  impossibility.

                <li classname="text-sm">
                  <strong>2023 (Red Sea Crisis):</strong> Shipping delays led to

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                Force majeure is no longer obscure legalese. It's now part of
                every contract's resilience architecture especially for
                businesses exposed to global inputs and cross-border
                dependencies.

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                And in this rare-earth disruption, the clause is not a surprise
                fallback, it's the only defense Indian importers can legally
                activate as geopolitical control overrides commercial flow.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                China's sudden freeze on rare-earth magnet export licences has
                brought it back into play, not as a fringe clause, but as the
                primary legal shield available to Indian importers.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                More than 30 importers are now reportedly moving to invoke force
                majeure, as critical shipments stall, with no clarity on
                approvals from Beijing.

                The Stakes: Beyond Penalties and Delays

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                This isn't a pricing dispute or a logistics bottleneck. The
                magnets exist. The suppliers are ready. The problem? Licences
                aren't being issued.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">For Indian importers, that means:</p>

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                Force majeure is the only lever to pause liability, but it won't
                stop the downstream ripple unless it holds under scrutiny.

              <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-[#789BFF] mb-2">
                What Makes This Disruption Different?

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                This isn't about breakdowns or disasters. This is pure sovereign

                A foreign government, for reasons of international politics, is

              </p>
              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                That takes force majeure into a very specific legal zone, one
                that depends not on hardship or cost, but on:
              </p>
              <ul className="mb-4 space-y-2 list-disc ml-6">
                <li classname="text-sm">The precise wording of the clause</li>

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                This is not about discovering force majeure. It's about whether
                your version of it can stand up to a foreign policy
                weaponisation event.

                Force majeure can work, but not all clauses are equal.

                Most OEM-supplier contracts include general references to
                "government action" or "regulatory interference." But in cases
                like this, the legal strength depends on:
              </p>
              <ul className="mb-4 space-y-2 list-disc ml-6">
                <li classname="text-sm">
                  Does the clause explicitly mention foreign export

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                Without precision and procedural discipline, even valid claims
                can be contested. And with stakes this high, OEMs may not accept
                broad assertions without proof.

                This is not a niche importer issue. It's a boardroom issue.

                For key industries like auto, electronics, renewables, and
