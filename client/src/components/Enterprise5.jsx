                What the Finance Function Actually Needs to Transform
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                If behavioural transformation is the missing link, the solution
                must be rooted in{" "}

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                Here's what has actually worked in organisations that made the

              </h4>

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                Instead of training people on Power BI, identify specific
                high-usage reports, e.g., cash flow tracker, revenue bridge,
                payables ageing, and rebuild them inside the new system with the

              </h4>

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                Make it operational policy that monthly packs, internal business
                reviews, or board reporting are to be conducted only via live
                dashboards or new format exports. Even if there is initial
                discomfort, the constraint itself builds capability over time.
              </p>

                3. Appoint Functional Enablers, Not Change Evangelists

              <p className="mb-8 text-sm">
                Pick two to three high-performing individuals inside the finance

                Until that shift is made - systemically, managerially, and
